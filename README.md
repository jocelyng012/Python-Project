# Python-Project

Under the supervision of Professors Juan Flores and Michal Young, I completed Python projects for Sequences CS 210 and CS 211 at the University of Oregon. The projects were completed using the high-level programming language Python as part of my Introduction to Computer Science course.
<br>
<br>

Below is the overview of all the projects that are in the GitHub repository: 
<br>
<br>

***Anagrams***
  * Find possible anagrams of words and phrases, including phrases of more than one word
  * Practice creating a collection of class
  * Recursive solution of an enumeration problem
  * Aliasing issues and mutable data structures

Example with seed crime
```shell
python3 anagram.py --seed crime "Computer Science"
```
```text
crime concept use    crime cup scene to   crime cup once set
```
<br>
<br>


***Calculator***
  * Build a simple interactive postfix (Reverse Polish) calculator
  * Develop redundant code from concrete subclasses into a shared abstract base class
  * Recursive traversal of object structures

Interaction with ```rpncalc.py``` will look like: 
```
Expression (return to quit):5 6 * x =
x = (5 * 6) => 30
Expression (return to quit):x 3 *
(x * 3) => 90
Expression (return to quit):
Bye! Thanks for the math!
```
<br>
<br>


***FiveTwelve***
  * Sliding tile game based on 2048
  * Follows Model-View-Controller (MVC) organization or design pattern
  * Keep track of list of list and test scaffolding structures

Initial board & After:
<div class="image-row">
  <img src="z_img/initial.png" width="100" height="100" >
  <img src="z_img/Game-with-score.png" width="100" height="100" >
</div>
<br>
<br>


***Sodoku Solver***
  * A solver for the classic Sodoku
  * Implement constraint propagation and back-tracking search
  * Model-View-Controller (MVC) organization associates a graphical display with the game

Apply with the Soduku solver:
<div class="image-row">
  <img src="z_img/hs-before.png" width="200" height="200" >
  <img src="z_img/hs-after.png" width="200" height="200" >
</div>
<br>
<br>


***Ciphers***
  * Several cipher algorithms including Simple transposition, Three-rail, ROT-13, and Cipher chooser
  * Design encrypt and decrypt functions
<br>
<br>


***Clustering***
  * Implement k-means clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm
  * Introduction of Machine Learning
  * Structured code
<br>
<br>


***Computing &#960;***
  * Approximate &#960; using Archimedes, Wallis, and Monte Carlo
  * Deterministic vs. Non-deterministic algorithms
  * Turtle graphics to visualize the Monte Carlo solution
<br>
<br>


***Data Analysis***
  * Read data from the CSV file
  * Experiment with a common benchmark from the area of Machine Learning
  * Matplotlib visualization and data analysis
<br>
<br>


***Population Data Analysis***
  * Read data from the JSON file
  * Structured code by creating dictionaries and lists
  * Analysis and visualize data
<br>
<br>


***Postfix Notation***
  * Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
  * Using strings and lists to evaluate arithmetic expressions given in postfix notation
